## Introduction

Machine learning is a fascinating field that combines statistical analysis with computer science to enable systems to learn and make decisions without explicit programming. In this repository, I have documented my journey through basic statistics concepts and popular machine learning algorithms. The goal is to provide a resource that is both educational and practical, allowing anyone to follow along and build a solid foundation in machine learning.

## Repository Structure

- **`/statistics`**: This directory contains notebooks and scripts related to basic statistics concepts, including descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, probability, and more.

- **`/machine_learning_algorithms`**: Here, you'll find implementations and explanations of various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and more.

- **`/datasets`**: A collection of datasets used throughout the 100 days. Each dataset is carefully selected to cover different aspects of machine learning and statistics.

- **`/resources`**: Additional resources, including books, articles, and online courses that complement the content covered during the 100 days.

## Usage

Explore the notebooks and scripts in the `/statistics` and `/machine_learning_algorithms` directories to delve into the world of basic statistics and machine learning. Each file is accompanied by comments and explanations to facilitate understanding.
